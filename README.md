# Eyes on You:Face Detection and Recognition System
It is a Face detection and recognition project build with the help of Machine Learning Algorithms and enhanced by using the features of OpenCV.
## How to run?
* First create a folder named "dataset".
* Run "face_dataset.py" file in terminal by using command "python face_dataset.py".
* Similarly run "training.py" file after that.
* And lastly run "face_recognition.py" file in the same manner.
After running "face_dataset.py" file, it will detect your face and take pictures for creating dataset for training. These pictures will be stored in dataset folder.
## Technologies Used
* Python3
* Machine Learning
* OpenCV
* Computer Vision
